## âœ¨ Features

- **Modern & Responsive Design:** Built with Flexbox and Media Queries for a seamless experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## ðŸŽ¨ Customization Guide

This template is ready to be adapted for your own service. Here are the key areas to customize:

-   **Marketing Copy:** All text content in `index.html`, `remove.html`, and `contact.html` is placeholder. You should replace the headlines, descriptions, service features, and pricing tiers to match your specific product.

-   **Form Endpoint:** The most critical change. In `assets/js/script.js`, you need to replace the simulated API call with a real one. Find this section:

    ```javascript
    // --- Simulate API call (replace with actual fetch in production) ---
    try {
        // ...
        // For now, we just simulate a delay
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1500));
        // ...
    } 
    ```
    
    Replace the `try` block with your actual `fetch` call to send the form data to your backend.

-   **Branding & Colors:** You can easily change the entire site's color scheme by editing the CSS variables at the top of `assets/css/style.css`.

    ```css
    :root {
        --bg-color: #0d0d0d;
        --primary-color: #00ff99;
        /* ...and so on */
    }
    ```
